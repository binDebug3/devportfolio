                        <h4>Hey you silly goose</h4>

                 
                        <p> Thanks for being awesome and for being my girlfriend. You've made my whole year better and I love
                            how thoughtul and supportive you are. I've made you this little note to show you how much I care 
                            but I know you like paper so I'll make sure to write you a letter too.
                        </p>

                            Since one of the advantages of digital media is all the pictures I can include I've decided to 
                            abuse this privelege.

                        <figcaption>I love skiing with you! Its made the winter so much fun and now that the commute
                            is just more time with you I don't worry about it. This might be a little unfortunate but
                            you're very cute when you're terrified and start singing or swearing in french hehe. Glad
                            I was able to unintentionally catch your ski that one time.

                            work and never easy but I'm glad you get to enjoy it so much.
                            It was so fun to meet your family too! I'm glad I got to spend a little
                            more time with them since. You're brothers are like little forces of nature but skiing was
