                        <h4>Hey hotty</h4>

                 
                        <p> Thanks for being awesome and for being my girlfriend. You've made my whole year better and I love
                            how thoughtul and supportive you are. I've made you this little note to show you how much I care 
                            but I know you like paper so I'll make sure to write you a letter too.
                        </p>

                        <p> 
                            Since one of the advantages of digital media is all the pictures I can include I've decided to 
                            abuse this privelege. The pictures are a little big so I hope you like them lol.

                        <figcaption>I love skiing with you! Its made the winter so much fun and now that the commute
                            is just more time with you I don't worry about it. This might be a little unfortunate but
                            you're very cute when you're terrified and start singing or swearing in french hehe. Glad
                            I was able to unintentionally catch your ski that one time.

                            work and never easy but I'm glad you get to enjoy it so much.
                            It was so fun to meet your family too! I'm glad I got to spend a little
                            more time with them since. You're brothers are like little forces of nature but skiing was 
                            sure fun with thme

                            And thanks for sharing some of your favorite things and places with me. Delicate Arch was 
                            very magic, especially during the off season.

                        <p>Photo montages aside, I am grateful for you and all the joy you bring to my life. I'm glad I get to 
                            spend time with you and I'm excited for all the adventures we'll have together. You are a smart, 
                            capable, speedy, and beautiful person. You're careful to look out for the people around you and help 
                            them feel appreciated and heard. I love your quirks and silliness, and even though you're an 
                            unrepentent dp addict who only likes apples, you're super fun to tease and spend time with. Thanks 
                            for indulging all my computer passion projects, nerd talk, and childhood hobbies like Pokemon and Magic. 
                            Thanks for hours of fun, random fun facts, off the dome deep questions (even poorly specified ones), 
                            tickles, cuddles, kisses, and peace. You're amazing. Have the most magic day :D
