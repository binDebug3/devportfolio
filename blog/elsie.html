                        <h4>Hello there,</h4>

                 
                        <p>So I know you really like letters but I thought this might be novel enough to be almost as good.
                            And guess what? All the wonderful attributes of letters you mentioned are here too! But on top of that,
                            you don't have to keep track of it and it's way easier to include pictures! And I'm pround to be yet 
                            another place you've been featured on the internet. 
                            Did I see a Bountiful High School Sterling Scholar in Instrumental Music?? Anyways life is good 
                            because the sun is shining and I just talked to my family who I'm going to get to see in a week. 
                            I get to hang out with this great girl and its fun to see her constant love and excitement for life. 
                            Even if she has a mild obsession for Dr. Pepper and hasn't beaten Hughy at the Wordle yet :)  
                        </p>

                        <img src="blog_files/elsie/pika.jpg">
                        <figcaption>I thought you might enjoy this cute picture of a pika. Fun fact I have two fun facts abouts pikas.
                            (1) According to reddit pikas can adjust their body temperature by changing their posture. 
                            These two common postures are referred to as “puff” and “lounge”.
                            (2) This is the animal that Pikachu is based off of.
                        </figcaption>

                        <p> 
                            Also great job on catching up on all the best movies of our generation that you've somehow missed 
                            to this point, it's been fun watching them with you and getting to experience them again. Hopefully 
                            you've been able to experience the joy and marvel of the internet in a new way today.

                            If the website looks off center that's because I removed the sidebar I normally have because this
                            page isn't actually part of or connected to my blog but I already had a nice template set up.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            P.S.
                        </p>
                        <p>Knock knock.</p>
