                    <p>
I am a master's student in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a graduate from the Applied and Computational Math Emphasis (ACME) at Brigham Young University. I love to use computer science and math to understand the world around me, make predictions, and solve problems. In my free time I enjoy playing spikeball, ultimate frisbee, and all kinds of games. </br></br>

I started my college education as an electrical engineer. 
            While I enjoyed my classes, I started to learn more about the possibilities
            that math enables like machine learning and data analysis. I had a 
            hard time letting go of my plans to become an engineer, but I get so excited learning
            about the power that math has to teach a computer to learn and help us 
            understand the world better that I knew I needed to change directions. </br></br>

ACME is a unique and intensive intersection of advanced mathematics,
            statistics, and computer science designed to prepare people to solve
            21st century problems. As the foundation for modern technology, a deep
            understanding of mathematics has enabled me to develop skills for successful 
	    algorithm design, effective data analysis, and creating innovative solutions 
	    to modern challenges.

The Family Map app provides a geographical view of your family history by plotting important events in your ancestors’ lives on a Google map.</br>

This project uses a client/server architecture. The client is an Android app that lets a user view and interact with their family history data, and the server is a Java program that runs in the cloud. 
When users login, the client app retrieves the user’s family history data from the server, which maintains accounts and dispenses family history data.

This project, affectionately named Casper, is a python program that uses selenium to gather used car sales data online from local retailers including AutoTrader, CarsDirect, CarGuru, Carvana, Lowbook, and KSL. As of the most recent update, Casper only searches for cars in the Provo, Utah area. After 
gathering data, Casper scores each car on how good of a deal the sale is and generates a CSV report of the current market in addition to the market history since November 2022 when I first began the project.
